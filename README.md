## Introduction 

  This project is a capstone project for the completion of the [Google Data Analytics Certification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/AHR8TAZNRZGJ). The scenario involves a fictitious company called "Cyclistic", which provides bike-share services in Chicago. This program features more than 5,800 bicycles across 600 docking stations. Customers who purchased single-ride or full-day passes are classified as "casual" riders. The customers who purchased annual memberships are "members". The director of marketing is aiming to maximize the number of annual memberships for future growth of the company. 
  
## Buiness Objective 

  The main objective set by the director of marketing is, 
  
    "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
